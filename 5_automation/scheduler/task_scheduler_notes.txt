Customer Churn Analysis – Automation & Scheduling Notes
---------------------------------------------------------

Objective:
Automate monthly churn report generation using Python and schedule it to run without manual intervention.

Script Used:
monthly_churn_report.py  
(Generated from monthly_churn_report.ipynb using nbconvert)

Original Notebook Path:
C:\Users\Prafull Wahatule\Desktop\Customer-Churn-Analysis\3_python\scripts\monthly_churn_report.ipynb

Automation Tool:
Windows Task Scheduler

Schedule Frequency:
Monthly (1st day of every month at 9:00 AM)

Steps to Configure Task Scheduler:
1. Open Windows Task Scheduler
2. Click "Create Basic Task"
3. Name: Monthly Customer Churn Report
4. Trigger:
   - Monthly
   - Repeat every 1 month
5. Action:
   - Start a Program
6. Program/script:
   - Path to python.exe  
     Example:
     C:\Users\Prafull Wahatule\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python311\python.exe
7. Add arguments:
   - "C:\Users\Prafull Wahatule\Desktop\Customer-Churn-Analysis\3_python\scripts\monthly_churn_report.py"
8. Start in:
   - "C:\Users\Prafull Wahatule\Desktop\Customer-Churn-Analysis\3_python\scripts\"
9. Configure:
   - Run whether user is logged in or not
   - Run with highest privileges

Output:
- Generates monthly churn KPI summary
- Saves report locally (CSV / Excel / PDF)
- Logs execution status

Error Handling:
- Python try-except blocks handle runtime failures
- Execution status written to automation_logs.txt

Business Impact:
- Eliminated manual monthly reporting
- Ensured timely churn insights
- Improved reporting accuracy and consistency
